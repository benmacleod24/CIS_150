# Problems

The problems I ran into with this homework assignment is the way I think and want to implement things. I had to find the cleanest and efficent way to create both application that fully worked. The way I overcame that was by validating the input we obtained was what we are looking for, instead of looking for invalid inputs. In some cases I did have to look for specific invalid input but that was a given.

## Program One

Simply run the program when you wish to play. You will jump right into the game with 5 attempts displayed at the top and a request for your input. You have the choice to enter a letter for a letter guess or a word for a word guess. It will then evaluate the input and determine a response from there. After the 5 attempts you get if you have guessed it then you win, otherwise you lose.

## Program Two

Program two when ran will simply greet you with a menu of operations you can perform. Once you submit an option it will ask you for a number, and then ask you for a second number. Once entered it will compute the response or produce an error if one exist. After that it will display your mathmatical operation to you with the results.
