## Homework 05 - Ben Macleod

This app was a pretty easy one for me and I didn't run into many issues if any at all. My issues where deciding how I want to make everything as modular as possible. I feel like I came to a very good solution to allow anything to be removed and allow the program to still run. Made it very easy to change return types and value types so if you wanted `float` or `double` to be used in the program.

### How to use it!

The program is very easy to use when you run the program you will be prompted with a menu and asked to input an option between 1 and 10. After that it will prompt you for the values it needs to do the operation; if doing absolute value it will only prompt you for one. Once that has been done it will display the results to you and ask if you want to run again. It will either run it again or end the application.
