# Problems

I didn't run into many issues on these programs, but one I did run into was the `sizeof(primeNumbers)` not giving me the correct size which I find a little funny. Other than that I didn't run into too many issues.

## Breifing

This program is very simple and and easy to understand/use. There is nothing to input all you have to do run the program and it will cycle through a set amount of numbers to see whiche ones are prime. Once it has done that it will display them to you with the total number of prime numbers in that range.
