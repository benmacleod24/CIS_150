# Problems

I didn't really run into problems with these programs it was much easier for me because it allowed me to think in my typical way of programming.

## Program One

The second hangman application we have made, but this one is built for 2 players and is dynamic to any word or sentence that may be entered. The code itself is very dynamic so your able to easily change the max number of attempts for words and letters.

## Program Two

This program was fun to make because it allowed me to do a lot of testing around with C++ syntax and structure. You can simply enter a sentence and it will give you 4 actions to perform on that string for you. It will then keep asking for an action until you enter the exit code `(default = -999)`. The code is very clean and easy to edit and change around config varibles.
