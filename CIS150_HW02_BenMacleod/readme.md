I didn't run into many issues on these programs, but one I did run into was the cout function. I figured it our before you showed us getLine in class, but I found it very interesting the way it works. One thing I did find frustrating about it was that I couldn't get a return value from that function.

## Program One

Program one allows a user to input a number/dollar value and it will give you back fewest number of bills it can be broken down into.
The program is very simple to use, when you run the program it will simply prompt you for a value in which you should enter a number and press enter. Once you have done that it will run it's calculations and present you with the fewest bills.

## Program Two

Program two allows a user to input a city name and the position at which any character in the letter would be. It is very easy to use, to start enter a city name and after doing so you will be asked for a position in the name. Once you have entered that information the system will find the character at that position and display it to you.
